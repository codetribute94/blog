### THE PATHWAY TO QUALITY EDUCATION
In the year 2000, the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan with other world leaders signed the MDG declaration aim at improving the lives of individuals across the world. After 15 years, the goals achieved great success as evident in the reduced infant and maternal mortality rates across Africa, increased enrollment of children in school and a general improvement in the standards of living. This gave the world a peek at what could be achieved if the world leaders are united behind a common goal, the SDG announced by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki Mon was as a result of global leaders wanting to sustain the growth and improvement achieved by the MDG’s. The 17 global goals are equally important to the continual progress and advancement of humanity, but goals number 1 and 4 resonate with me and hence my continual advocacy and support for their actualization.

Open education is important if the world is to push forward in its bid to attain quality education for all. Education is the foundation on which everything else rests: our economy, our democracy, our heritage, and our future. To accomplish anything as a society, whether that be protecting the environment, addressing inequality or eradicating poverty, we need an educated, literate citizens that can reason systematically, comprehend knowledge-based principles, and work collaboratively to solve the big problems that confront us. My interest in education reform stems from a desire to foster these kinds of abilities in people and to begin from a young age, hence I believe free and open access to knowledge can have a profound impact on the lives of people around the world.
In 2010, the Commonwealth of Learning reported that:
“Nearly one-third of the world’s population (29.3%) is under 15. Today there are 165 million people enrolled in tertiary education. Projections suggest that participation will peak at 263 million in 2025. Accommodating the additional 98 million students would require more than four major universities (30,000 students) to open every week for the next fifteen years. (Daniel, 2011)”.
Our traditional campus-based model of higher education cannot conceivably solve this problem.

Open Education is a movement in education to take advantage of the power of the Internet to dramatically increase access to knowledge and It's inspired by the wild success of Wikipedia and the proven impact power of the Open Source software movement. We all endorse the notion that teaching, learning, and research are improved when educational resources are made open and more accessible, and this has been made possible by the merging of education with the ICT revolution. Open education increases access to millions of learners while simultaneously improving the productivity of the educational system.

Education is the launching pad for development, and is required if we hope to create rewarding or meaningful work for the bulging population of young people across the globe.

The world’s fate, future, and vitality depends on the quality of education we can pass on to the next generation..
