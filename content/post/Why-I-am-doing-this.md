>That's life (that's life), that's what all the people say
You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June

>I said that's life (that's life), and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'cause this fine old world, it keeps spinnin' around

>I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

>That's life (that's life), I tell you I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby, but my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly
#### Frank Sinatra - That's Life

### Why I am doing this.
Well I haven’t written in a long time, must have been caught up in the web of life seeking only how to survive. It very easy to slip into this mindless cycle of living day to day while loosing sight of your dream and desire to do more and be more. The last time I wrote here was about 4 years ago and things have changed a lot from that time. I finally graduated after all, moved into a better place with mom and in general have a better life than the previous decade. While this might have come at some cost, stopped writing, reading and gave up voluntary service, I thrived financially, socially, health wise ( like I did add weight ) and generally have a better living standard, but then appeared the void which I have been unable to satisfy, giving room to question the past years if it truly was what I  really wanted. I’m truly grateful to AIESEC which helped me build my self-awareness allowing me the ability to question myself, motives and decisions. The ability to step out of myself and see things from an outside perspective is an invaluable gift, while I might have experienced an impressive outward growth, inwardly I was stagnated and lost. The journey to self discovery has been on since around march 2019 and I have slowly be making effort into getting back to the life and activities I love that gave me a meaning, it might not have happened overnight, it’s perfectly fine cause I didn’t loose them overnight. A part of my plan was to resume writing slowly but thanks to covid-19 which has even offered me a deeper need to reflect I have decided to resume now and share my thoughts, while freeing my mind. Going forward I will be sharing my thought on anything from personal development, entrepreneurship, growth, finance, technology, economy etc.
Have a good life!!!
