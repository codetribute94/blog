### “Choose a cause, cause a change". - Solomon Okafor
I will like to start this post with two mind-blowing quotes.

>“It does not take a majority to prevail... but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.”
-- Samuel Adams

>"If you think you are too small to make a difference, try sleeping with a mosquito." ~ Dalai Lama

It is very pathetic, that we see young people go around complaining about everything that is wrong in the country, transferring blames from the government to industries, all the while doing nothing to solve or alleviate the problem. Even I have once been a victim of this thought process, but never have I seen a situation where complaining led to a solution (please I stand to be corrected). We are currently living in the age of the youth, the global population of young people by far exceed that of the old, and also do we have the tools that encourage mass communication like social media, blogs, podcast, webinars etc.

Majority of African countries enjoy democracy, which encourages people to hold their government accountable. The time has come for young people mostly especially in Africa to take responsibility for their lives and those around them, by becoming active participant in governance, business and policy-making. This is a clarion call to young people to stop complaining and become more solution oriented. You can cause a change by volunteering for a local non-profit, become an outspoken advocate on particular issues, the world has 17 SDG’s pick the one that most resonate with you and let your voice be heard. There is a couple of amazing young people who have taken their passion to the next level by innovatively providing solution to some of these issues, examples include Rachel Jacobs (Beyond the classroom foundation.), Otto Orondaam (slum2school).

You too can become a change maker, All you simply need do is find something you care about and care deeply.
