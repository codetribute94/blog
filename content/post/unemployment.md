### The Nigeria dilemma ###
In Africa, unemployment is one of the greatest problems facing this emerging continent where over 68% of young people between the ages of 18 -40 are jobless. Though this situation varies from country to country, but it is still at an epidemic level. In majority of sub-Saharan Africa where I come from, I came to understand the level of degradation and a seriousness of the matter during the course of interaction with two friends of mine who were about to graduate from the university. During the course of our discussions, it became clear that these people didn’t have the slightest idea of what they are going to be doing after school or how they were going the cope, rather they have concluded in their minds to return to their parents and guardians to seek shelter and comfort.

This being the story of more than 50 surveyed graduates leaving the universities across Nigeria, with the best responses being that they were planning on coming back for a second degree in the respective course they actually love. The level of fear present in these over 50 students surveyed arouse out of the fact that
- There was no gainful employment in sight.
- They were not skilled in any particular sector or area that can allow them feed irrespective of their guardian.

This is pitiable situation that should not be allowed to continue. I deduced from the study that over 85% of graduates being churned out from our degree awarding institutions left without any particular skill sets that might set them apart or cater for them for a while.
Allow me to say this is a disaster, a time bomb that Nigeria is sitting on with its high number of unemployed youths.
It is disheartening that in the age of IT, where every body is advised to acquire at least one computer related skill has yet to be digested.
The truth that I concluded was that with IT skills, it is practically impossible for some one to be unemployed or jobless. This conclusion came from my observation of more than 100 young people who are skilled in basic MS-office suite which we refer to as computer appreciation where people learn basic skills like CorelDraw, power point, word etc.
This young people have being able to use these skills to achieve a certain level of comfort and pay their bills without getting involved in anything illegal.
The fact that majority of African countries have failed to understand the importance and impact of IT still amazes me, if you refer to the other article written on e-Business –“the newest trends in Nigeria”.
