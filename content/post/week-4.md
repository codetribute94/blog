### Week Four - Review

>“Without data you’re just another asshole with an opinion.”

Week 4 of my Data science self-study challenge has been a great, as I was able to pull myself out of the drowning feeling from last week. I successfully finished module 4 which had become such a burden for over two weeks. I have sincerely been learning a lot about the field of data science and AI, as I seem not to be able to get enough of this subject matter. I’m currently studying module 5, Database for Data science, and I sincerely hope I can be done before the week ends.
So much to learn in such short timeframe, I’m currently also taking an MIT ocw  course on Single variable calculus that is a prerequisite  for taking the multivariate course which an essential required mathematical knowledge for studying and understanding data science and ML. It been a while I done some cool mathematics and feel a bit fuzzy not been able to grasp all the content but we keep pushing.
The reading for this week is “Data Science by John D Kelleher and Brendan Tierney. Book Review coming up soon.
