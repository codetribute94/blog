### Week one - review

This week was the first of my 9 months (36 weeks) data science challenge, I intend to finish a home-study syllabus on data science that would prepare me for either a job or path to postgraduate studies in data science. This is no easy feat but I am committed and bent on finishing till the end.
I officially began my studies by enrolling in the IBM-Digital Nation program which seems addictive due to the gamification element added to the program, human beings are by nature competitive and the desire to increase my badges keeps  me motivated and resilient towards the challenges faced in the courses. Also I enrolled for the IBM Data science certificate program on coursera and so far it also has been an amazing experience.
Another thing I have found to be an astonishing companion was Scott Young’s brilliant book “Ultralearning” which was part of my reading list for the year, it was such a timely conjunction and has been such a useful compass on my path towards accomplishing my goal, If you have a desire to do stunning things in your life I advise you to read the book. I would do a proper book review for it in the days to come but until then please get a copy. IBM has
14 Data Science Badges and 17 AI Badges on their learning page I hope to pick up all of that by the time I’m done with this challenge.
The biggest challenge I had encountered was during the last module on Data Science methodology, I found is a bit uneasy to answer the last question concerning processes for applying the CRISP-DM to my own projects, but in the end it was quite nice and I enjoyed working on all the projects and modules.
From this week I intend to finish up 2 courses per week to be able to meet my deadline of finishing up within a month, and I guess the past week was an introductory class and might have been mild but the shit is about to get real from this week onwards.  
Not deterred , we move
Cheers!!!
