>A man who has a handiwork will never go hungry.
 - Africa proverb.

>To maximize the dividend, sub-Saharan Africa will be have to create high productivity jobs at an average of about 18million jobs per year until 2035 – an extremely rapid and possibly unprecedented rate to absorb the new entrants in the labor force failure to create sufficient jobs could result in severe economic and social problems. – Regional economic outlook (sub-Saharan Africa ) 2016

The fear of unemployment is one of the major concerns of young people across Africa; In Nigeria we hear such things like unemployment and unemployability. The then minister of finance and economy Ngozi okonjo Iweala has been quoted as saying “Nigeria youth are unemployable”. In this context, unemployable refers to someone with the right persona but insufficient skill for a task. The oxford dictionary describes unemployable as someone lacking the skills or quality that is needed to get a job. Believe me, I don’t think that there is a shortage of jobs in Nigeria but rather a shortage of visionaries, an average African (Nigeria) is very myopic they can’t see beyond their nose, always looking for immediate gratification up till today I have not been able to grasp why we have such high unemployment rate and such high demand in skilled labor (it doesn’t just make sense).

I think its high time young people start taking responsibility for their lives and stop waiting for some government or multinational company. GO GET SKILLED. Learn something, the rule of the thumb I advise is look for your passion and get skilled in that area, because it will allow you to be more happy, diligent and preserve when things are tough.

We live in a very dynamic generation where you have to keep an open mind be able to learn, unlearn and relearn almost instantaneously.

Technology is a great enabler of economic development and innovation, hence I believe everyone should get technical at least pickup one technical skill, this will always allow you be ahead of the curve in what ever sector you function.

GET SKILLED, GET AHEAD.
