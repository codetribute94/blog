### Week Two - review


This week has been a bit uneasy compared with the first just like l thought, learning has slowed down, as I seem to be struggling little with some concept in my python class. But though it might be a bit challenging I still find python to be more intuitive than javascript background where I’m coming from, I wasn’t able to meet the weekly average of studying 2 modules in a week as it was a lot tougher than the first week were I was introduced with the basics.
It seems obvious to me that I might be unable to meet my goal to be done in exactly one month due to this inability to complete 2 module in this past week.
I hope to apply a lot more pressure and focus in the coming week to enable me meet the new weeks goal.
My monthly reading is _Utralearning_ but Scott Young and I am also quite behind on that, so I don’t have a choice but to speed up my reading also to make sure I get it done in time.
That’s all till next week guys.
