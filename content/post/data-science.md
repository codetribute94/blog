## Learner In Transit season 2
So I recently undertook a new goal to learn and specialize in the field of data science. I just took a keen interest in data science as a field and have been researching and reading up on this new and novel space in science. This is a pretty new field in science just a little over a decade old, while everyone is still trying to fully comprehend this field it’s already proven very useful and leading to new advancement in areas such as machine learning, deep learning, AI and robotics making it possible to do things we formally thought to be impossible. While there is ongoing debate on whether data science should be recognized as a field of science or just a translational science which cuts across various other studies. This contention is obviously visible due to the intersection of mathematics, computer science and statistical studies which embodies data science. But that’s the argument for data science, and its not my focus as I have continued to be captivated and fascinate by the sheer impact of the new science from the areas of healthcare, to finance, to transportation, businesses and commerce and technology, it’s transforming the way we live and carry out our daily activities and I really want in on this. So I’m committing to a 9 months of intense studies to build up my data science knowledge  and in the process make remarkable contributions to this field. I am not super smart but I’m willing to put in the work to get good results and see myself grow in this new found love for all things data.
So I have devised a plan to study data science and throw myself into the frontlines while learning all I need to survive and deliver on assignments and projects. I sincerely hope it’s as fun as it’s as hard.
Below is my table for learning, I hope to stick to it till the very end. I will keep revising it to add or remove certain things I find not useful or very important in the cause of my journey.

I will keep on updating my blog weekly on my progress.
See you on the other side, Cheers!!!
