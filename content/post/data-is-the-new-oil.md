> “Data is the new oil. It’s valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. It has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so must data be broken down, analyzed for it to have value.” - UK Mathemetician and architect of Tesco’s Clubcard, 2006


> “Just like oil was a natural resource powering the last industrial revolution, data is going to be the natural resource for this industrial revolution. Data is the core asset, and the core lubricant, for not just the entire economic models built around every single industry vertical but also the socioeconomic models.” - Abhishek Mehta, CEO Tresata, 2013

## The age of data


The discovery of oil enabled the rise of the industrial revolution by powering the machines which led to the amazing growth of the world and increased the prosperity of nations. In this article I will try to lay down the basis for the direct comparison of data to oil.  At every inflexion point of a new technology people are always scared of the impact it would have on their lives from the loss of jobs to the AI apocalypse which is associated with AI and ML which are major use cases of data.  The promise of the fourth industrial revolution is same as the previous, Data like oil would be a defining factor in how we view the world in the nearest future, the companies and nations that best understand and utilize their data would be at the bleeding edge of the revolution.

#### Origins:

The 19th century was a characterized by great change and rapid industrialization. The iron and steel industry spawned new construction materials, the railroads connected the country and the discovery of oil provided a new source of fuel. The discovery of the Spindletop geyser in 1901 drove huge growth in the oil industry. Within a year, more than 1,500 oil companies had been chartered, and oil became the dominant fuel of the 20th century and an integral part of the American economy. And enter the fourth industrial revolution that is powered by cloud, social, mobile, the Internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), along with increasing computing power and data. The 21st century has seen a rise in data and computing power which has led to the unravelling of new frontiers of technology we once thought impossible. The truth is data like oil has been around forever but we weren’t able to grasp or fathom how to properly make use of it. This will lead to my next point on how this became possible during the 19th century and data in the 21st century.

#### Monetization:

There are a few concepts that are very important to the rise of oil in the last two centuries, the first one would be collection, in that oil required a means to collect and transport, the ingenuity of railways and pipelines were very consequential to the rise of the oil boom, so also was the storage capacity for oil and this was the second major factor that attributed to the rise of oil, the rise of steel and construction led to improvement in materials that enabled the building of oil reservoirs that could hold oil over a long time and distance providing means for storing oil. And the third factor would be processing, oil is constituted of PMS, gasoline, diesel, kerosene etc each which is processed into their various forms, as oil in its raw form isn’t of much value until it has undergone refining. The question would be how does all these relate to data, but the truth is if you know anything about data you would understand that data cannot be beneficial without a means to collect, store and process it, but with the rise of cloud technology and increased computing power all things are possible. Of course data didn’t get here all by itself some people where at the fore-front of this development, shaping the world as we know it.

#### Pioneers(PowerBrokers):

These are the men and women on who are rethinking and reshaping history, they are fore-runners paving the way for the rest of humanity seeking out more productive and efficient ways to do this and improve the general state of our lives, during the oil boom were men like J.D Rockfeller, Andrew Carnegie, Henri Deterding etc. this trend is also evident today as we watch the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Larry page and Sergio Brin lead us into the golden era of data and cloud technology, while amassing lots of wealth and power for themselves as is characteristic of such early pioneers and entrant in new technological cycles. This does not go to say that this future doesn’t come with its own challenges as would be made obvious in my next point.

#### Diasters & Scandals:

The oil industry has been riddled with scandals and tragedy of all sort, from oil spillage that has killed and displaced thousands of people and property to gross misconduct by leaders of this corporation. Allegations of bribery and corruption at all level has ridiculed even the most admired global oil brands.
Drawing a direct analogy from the oil industry will give us an idea of some of the challenges been faced in the data revolution as cases of data hacks, data    invasion and manipulation have been rising, the senate committee recently inquired a case involving Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook for allowing third party companies use Facebook to obtain data’s which they use for manipulating and influencing election results, just over a hundred years J.D Rockfeller was also in front of the senate committee for charges of market tampering and monopolization of the oil industry. We are experiencing an awakening as people are becoming more aware of their data and want to know how companies are using it, so as to avoid unethical use cases. Data privacy and ethics are becoming a big deal in the technology space and people are really beginning to ask question


#### Regulation:

The government is working to build regulations around the collection, processing and consumption of data, moves are been made to promote a more data ethical behavior among the big data users in the industry, data privacy is a big deal and people are woke to the fact that they leave digital traces online that can be used to build data profiles for them,


#### Products:
The rise of data science and AI has led to an amazing time for digital creator who can build product knowing exactly who their customers are and how to get them to buy. Data has made autonomous vehicles a thing, as well as medical devices that cost less than a 100$ and still deliver 95% accuracy in detection of disease than any doctor. We truly are living in a golden age. The age of data.


But despite all the similarities between oil and data, quite a few things do stand out about data that time and energy would constrain me not to talk about today, the most important take away is that we are living in an exciting time and things are going to get more strange and AI is going to be the driver of this change. For those afraid for their jobs, my advise is to "stay relevant, stay hungry".
Until next time people.
