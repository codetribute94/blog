### Technology as an economic enabler.
The consistent rise in the rate of unemployment in the country has been a source of worries and fear over the future of our dear beloved country. The recent statistics released by the NDE shows a consistent rise of about 12% over the past 10years. Thereby making Nigeria one of the highest ranked countries in the unemployment index. The major question on everyone’s lips has been “what is the government doing about this problem”?. But this trend has been gradually phasing out to give rise to the question – “what can we youth do on our own to solve this problem”?

There is an increasing reality among young people that the government cannot solve this problem alone, and this has led to quite a significant few going out of their way to start small enterprise which are gradually becoming household names example includes the examples of nairaland, bet9ja, jobberman, nottjustok, bellanaija, Francis Ebuchi (CEO - Dealfish). Companies like Sim Shagayas Konga.com and Jumia have become Multimillion dollar corporations.

You might point out a similarity among the example stated above as all having to do with the Internet (online enterprise). The future of the world is in the direction of electronic media (internet, online enterprise). Every Nigerian youth should be computer literate with the basics of Microsoft excel, outlook, word & PowerPoint. There is an increasing need for technical skills in the modern day work place. Also from the above notice that all the stated examples are works of deliberate mental creativity with the purpose of providing solutions to problems in their community. A recent post in the learning 4 living newsletter says “putting problems at the center of our decision-making changes everything, its not about the self anymore, It’s about what you can do and how you can become a valuable contributor”. For the nation to move ahead we have to stop thinking about our individual needs and start putting the nation as a whole in perspective. We can start developing creative solutions to the problems in our neighborhoods, communities, towns, cities, and state.

What big problems are you trying to solve? This article is the first in a series on youth development and job creation. It has been predicted that by the end of the year about 40% of the world population will be online. What is going to be your contribution?
