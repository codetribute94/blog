Now, if I had a list of favorites quote, I definitely think this quote would have a place on the list. The truth of this quote can only be explained by the dynamism of our current generation. Mark Zuckerberg once said in an interview that the most ignorant thing to do now is try and be safe. The extent of change been experienced currently will make it difficult for someone who lived 15years ago to comprehend.

In the past few years of thought in the evolution and dynamism of the Africa society, I have come to understand that my generation are truly lucky and might be the turning point generation that Africa needs. Born in an era where mobile technology has given us all a level playing ground, we have the opportunity to leapfrog the rest of the world and become the leader of the mobile revolution. Before we drift into technology, lets focus on the title of this post, later I will write a post on the mobile revolution for Africa.

For many people most especially expertsâ€™ millennia development has various meaning and definition, but personally I view millennia development as any set of principle, that if followed religiously will lead to better life for young people. Millennia also in my context refers to people born anywhere between 1980 till date. The five frameworks for millennia development is by no way a law or theory, but rather a rule of the thumb on what I think can contribute to the development, improvement and empowerment of young people all across Africa and the globe.

The Framework for millennia development includes.

- Choose a cause.
- Get skilled (Technical).
- Be Multilingual.
- Travel the world.
- Be an Expert.

The next post will explain explicitly each of the principle of millennia development.
